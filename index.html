      <div class="era">
        <h3>Formation and Early Years</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1958:</strong> NASA was established on July 29, 1958, in response to the Soviet Union's successful
            launch of Sputnik. The agency absorbed NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) and other related
            organizations.</li>
          <li><strong>1961:</strong> President John F. Kennedy set the goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of
            the 1960s, spurring the Apollo program.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="era">
        <h3>The Space Race and Moon Landing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1961:</strong> Alan Shepard became the first American in space with a suborbital flight on
            Mercury-Redstone 3.</li>
          <li><strong>1962:</strong> John Glenn orbited the Earth, marking a significant milestone in the Mercury
            program.</li>
          <li><strong>1969:</strong> Apollo 11 landed the first humans on the Moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
            walked on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins orbited above.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="era">
        <h3>Post-Apollo and Shuttle Era</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1970s:</strong> NASA continued lunar exploration with Apollos 12-17, and launched Skylab,
            America's first space station.</li>
          <li><strong>1981:</strong> The Space Shuttle program began with the launch of Columbia (STS-1). The reusable
            shuttle became central to NASA's missions, including satellite deployment, scientific research, and
            construction of the International Space Station (ISS).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="era">
        <h3>Tragedies and Triumphs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1986:</strong> The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster resulted in the loss of seven astronauts,
            prompting a reevaluation of the shuttle program.</li>
          <li><strong>2003:</strong> The Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon re-entry, leading to another tragic
            loss and further reforms in NASA’s safety protocols.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="era">
        <h3>International Collaboration and Modern Era</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1990s-2000s:</strong> NASA played a crucial role in the construction and operation of the ISS, a
            joint venture with international space agencies.</li>
          <li><strong>2011:</strong> The Space Shuttle program ended with the final flight of Atlantis (STS-135).</li>
          <li><strong>2010s-Present:</strong> NASA shifted focus to deep space exploration, launching the Artemis
            program to return humans to the Moon and eventually to Mars. Collaborations with private companies like
            SpaceX have revolutionized space travel, with notable achievements including the Commercial Crew Program and
            the Mars Perseverance rover mission in 2020.</li>

    <h2>Missions</h2>
    <p class="about">
      As one of the leading space organizations, NASA has undertaken numerous missions with diverse objectives. These
      missions range from flybys to landings, each contributing significantly to our understanding of the universe.
      NASA's endeavors have not only advanced scientific knowledge but have also had a profound impact on modern life.
      Many technologies we use today, such as satellite communications, weather forecasting, and even medical
      advancements, can trace their origins to NASA's innovative research and space missions. The organization's
      commitment to exploration has led to groundbreaking discoveries about our solar system and beyond. Some notable
      missions include the Mars Rover expeditions, which have provided invaluable data about the Martian surface, and
      the Voyager probes, which continue to send information from the far reaches of our solar system. These missions
      highlight NASA's pivotal role in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and technological capability.</p>

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p class="about">Here are some examples of achievements:NASA, as one of the leading space organizations, has
      achieved numerous milestones that have significantly advanced our understanding of space and technology. One of
      NASA's most notable achievements is the Apollo moon landing in 1969, which marked humanity's first steps on the
      lunar surface and provided invaluable data about our closest celestial neighbor. The development of the Space
      Shuttle program revolutionized space travel, enabling reusable spacecraft and paving the way for the construction
      of the International Space Station (ISS). The Hubble Space Telescope has offered unprecedented views of distant
      galaxies, stars, and planets, vastly expanding our knowledge of the universe. Mars exploration missions, such as
      the Mars Rover expeditions, have revealed the planet's geological history and potential for past life.
      Additionally, NASA's Earth science missions have enhanced our understanding of climate change, weather patterns,
      and natural disasters. These achievements underscore NASA's role in pushing the frontiers of science and
      technology.

  <section class="future-plans">
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p class="about">NASA's future plans are as ambitious and visionary as its past achievements. One of the most
      significant projects
      on the horizon is the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon by 2024 and establish a sustainable
      human presence by the end of the decade. This program will not only pave the way for lunar exploration but also
      serve as a stepping stone for future missions to Mars. Artemis includes the construction of the Lunar Gateway, a
      space station that will orbit the Moon and facilitate deep space exploration.

      Another groundbreaking initiative is the Mars Sample Return mission, in collaboration with the European Space
      Agency (ESA). This mission will collect samples from the Martian surface and return them to Earth for detailed
      analysis, potentially providing clues about the planet's past habitability and the possibility of life beyond
      Earth.

      NASA is also heavily invested in developing new technologies for space exploration. The agency is working on the
      Space Launch System (SLS), the most powerful rocket ever built, designed to carry astronauts and cargo to deep
      space destinations. Additionally, the Orion spacecraft is being developed to transport humans farther into space
      than ever before.

      On the forefront of science and technology, NASA plans to launch the James Webb Space Telescope, which will be the
      premier observatory of the next decade. This telescope is expected to make significant discoveries about the
      origins of the universe, the formation of stars and planets, and the potential for life in other solar systems.

      Furthermore, NASA continues to prioritize Earth science missions to monitor and understand our home planet’s
      climate and environmental changes. Through these and other innovative projects, NASA is poised to continue leading
      humanity’s exploration of space and expanding our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
